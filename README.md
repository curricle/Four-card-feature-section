## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that I don't particularly like the mobile-first workflow. Additionally, building style presets out into their own classes can be useful, but isn't always a foolproof method of making code more efficient; there's always some give and take.

### Useful resources
